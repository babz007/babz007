# Adeyemi Aina

👋 Hi there, I’m Adeyemi Aina — a systems engineer, researcher and open-source contributor passionate about building infrastructure that matters.

🎓 I recently earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, where I contributed to national-scale research platforms like OpenDSA and the Electronic Theses & Dissertations system. My work focused on scalable software systems, secure APIs, and AI-enhanced educational technology used by thousands of students and researchers.

💡 I specialize in turning impactful ideas into production-ready code — from NLP-based recruitment platforms to large-scale microservice architectures powering digital libraries.

🌍 I've contributed to **20+ open-source projects**, spanning distributed systems, developer tooling, AI ethics, data pipelines, and cloud-native deployments. These projects enable better access to education, more ethical AI design, and scalable infrastructure — all aligned with the U.S. national interest in innovation, education, and cybersecurity.

🛠️ Tech Stack: Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Flask, LLMs, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, and more.
